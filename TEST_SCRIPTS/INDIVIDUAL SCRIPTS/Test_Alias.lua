Toggle ship types to look for here (mix and match using true/false)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If looking for Exotics, it is recommended to disable all other types as well.
If other types are enabled alongside Exotics, it is assumed the primary
target are the other types, and Exotics may take a while to spawn.

You can technically disable everything, but then nothing will spawn.
You can also enable everything and ship pools will be as normal, but with
extra spawns and boosted turnover at trading posts.

Optional toggles for additional settings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that enabling either of these will cause the mod to load additional files.
These files will then conflict with any other mod that alters those files.

Forcing S-Class will force *everything* in the system to be S-class
including Ships, Freighters, and Multitool Cabinets.
This may be unwanted if you're trying to share coordinates, as a cabinet may not
normally be an S class.

Spawn Frequency Multiplier can be adjusted as well, but it will also load
another file and potentially cause conflict with other mods using that file.
Honestly, I didn't notice much of a difference using it, so default is off.

These are the files being used by this mod.
Adjust these if the filenames or directory structures ever change,
and the mod is no longer being maintained.

This mod will conflict with any other mod that alters these same files.
A spot for merging in code from conflicting mods is provided in the tables below.
Note that ONLY code from AMUMSS' EXML_CHANGE_TABLE blocks should be pasted there.

Two files are optional, and should only be active (and conflict with other mods)
if their associated optional toggles are enabled; Otherwise they shouldn't load.
One other file is *conditionally* optional: Only when nothing is filtered.
Space for merging code for all files exist in various functions at the bottom.
Look for spaces that have been marked as reserved for merging for each file.

Add/edit entries to/in this table if new ship types get added/modified.

Path to each model's Scene files should be exactly as found in the above file.
Ignoring Freighters and Living Ships because the latter doesn't spawn naturally.

This loop checks our shipInfo table to see which ship types have been enabled.

Disabled ones have entries created for AMUMSS to overwrite their model files
with empty strings to effectively prevent the game from being able to load them.
These are loaded into the empty table we'll declare below and will be recalled
later to insert the entries into the AMUMSS mod container, after it exists.
--]]

-- This table will be filled in automatically in a moment.
shipsToRemove	= {}

-- Scan through shipInfo and fill in the above table
for i = 1, #shipInfo do
	if not shipInfo[i].shipActive then
		shipsToRemove[#shipsToRemove + 1] = {
			["PRECEDING_FIRST"]		= "TRUE",
			PKW	= shipFaction,
			SKW	= {fileHandle, shipInfo[i].shipFile},
			VCT	= {
				{fileHandle, ""}
			},
		}
	end
end

-- We can now figure out how many ship types are active
-- We need this number to scale spawn rates with later
activeShipCount	= #shipInfo - #shipsToRemove

--[[
Define some multipliers for various spawn rate numbers we need.
These values have been tested to give pretty good results as-is
but can be altered for specific needs.
--]]

-- Space generally has fewer spawns than on-planet, so we'll boost those more
spaceSpawnMulti		= 2
-- If Exotics are the ONLY ship type enabled, we need to boost spawns dramatically
-- since their natural spawn rate is so low, otherwise you'd likely see nothing at all
exoticSpawnMulti	= (huntExotics and not (huntExplorers or huntFighters or huntHaulers or huntShuttles or huntSolars)) and 10 or 1
-- If Exotics are not the only type enabled (or not at all) then we'll boost
-- max active spawns a bit to handle the more numerous regular ships spawning
maxSpawnMulti		= exoticSpawnMulti > 1 and 1 or 2

--[[
Define spawn count limits.
Min/Max counts are reduced as more ship types are enabled.
This is because there's a greater chance to spawn them instead of "empty" spawns.
Reducing the count alleviates absolute chaos with 50+ ships spawning in at once.
Max active increases instead, to handle more "successful" ship spawns.
--]]

-- Minimum spawn count between 3 to 8 (80 if only Exotic)
minSpawns		= (#shipInfo + 3 - activeShipCount) * exoticSpawnMulti
-- Maximum spawn count between 5 to 10 (100 if only Exotic)
maxSpawns		= (#shipInfo + 5 - activeShipCount) * exoticSpawnMulti
-- Maximum active spawns total between 104 to 124 (520 if only Exotic)
